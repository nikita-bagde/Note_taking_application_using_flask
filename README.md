# Note_taking_application_using_flask
Task:
Refactor the existing codebase and ensure the proper functioning of the Note Taking Application. Document all identified bugs during the debugging process. The task is not about recreating the app from scratch. our goal is to fix the already existing codebase and make the application work as intended.

The First step is to create virtual environment (venv). [python -m venv .env_flask]
After creating venv next step is install flask and other required libraries. 
Run the python code.(python app.py)
